## Customizable hercules 3270 Logo
The initial welcome screen presented when a TN 3270 terminal connects to a hercules 3270 device can now be customized.
The customized logo is stored in a plain text file which contains positioning orders, attributes and variable substitutions.

Hercules also contains a built-in logo should no suitable file be found.
The built-in logo is contained in [cnsllogo.h](/cnsllogo.h) and is included in [console.c](/console.c).

## How to specify the logo file
Upon startup, Hercules will first look for a file named `herclogo.txt` in the current directory.
The logo file name can also be specified:
* as a startup option by using the `-b` flag.
* by using the `HERCLOGO` configuration statement.
(NOTE : The statement was previously LOGOFILE, but LOGOFILE has been deprecated).
* by using the `HERCLOGO` environment variable.
* at run time using the `HERCLOGO` panel command.

## How to create the logo file
Each line in the file represent either an order or a plain text line. The orders are as follows:  
`@SBA X,Y`   Position the current buffer position to Row X col Y (X and Y start at 0)  
`@SF [H][P]` Set the Highlight and/or Protected attribute  
`@NL`        Forces going to the next line  
`@ALIGN NONE|LEFT|RIGHT|CENTER`  
Specified the text alignement (relative to the left and right borders of the terminal). When ALIGN is other than "NONE", a new line is automatically inserted after each line of text. If ALIGN is "NONE", then the text will be written without skipping to the next line.

It is also possible to embbed substitution variables in outgoing text.  Substition is indicated by enclosing the variable name between $( and )

The following variables are defined in that environment :

`VERSION` : The hercules version  
`HOSTNAME` : The host name on which hercules is running  
`HOSTOS` : The host operating system  
`HOSTOSREL` : The Host operating system release  
`HOSTOSVER` : The host operating system version  
`HOSTARCH` : The host architecture  
`HOSTNUMCPUS` : UP (for 1) or MP=X (for more than 1)  
`LPARNAME` : The LPAR name specified in the configuration file  
`CCUU,ccuu,CUU,cuu` : Various forms of the device number of the terminal  
`CSS` : The Logical Channel Subsystem Set or Channel Set for the terminal  
`SUBCHAN` : The Subchannel number for the terminal  

Additionally, it is also possible to specify environment variable names.

The file [herclogo.txt](/herclogo.txt) is provided in the distribution as a sample template.
It reflects the contents of the built-in logo.
