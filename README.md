# The Hercules System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture Emulator

## The [SoftDevLabs](http://www.softdevlabs.com) version of Hercules 4.0 (Hyperion)

**Hercules** is an open source software implementation of the mainframe
System/370 and ESA/390 architectures, in addition to the latest 64-bit
z/Architecture. Hercules runs under Linux, Windows,
Solaris, FreeBSD,
and Mac OS X.

Hercules is [OSI Certified Open Source Software](http://www.opensource.org/)
licensed under the terms of the [Q Public Licence](http://fish-git.github.io/html/herclic.html).

This version of Hercules 4.0 Hyperion is a SoftDevLabs maintained version
of the Hercules emulator containing fixes made by myself and others for
bugs that may still exist in the original hercules-390 version of Hercules
4.0 Hyperion, as well as enhancements and improvements to the overall
functionality above and beyond what is provided by the hercules-390 version
of Hercules.

Hercules was created by Roger Bowler.

Jay Maynard "the Tron Guy" was the maintainer from 2000 to 2012.

Jan Jaeger designed and implemented many of the advanced features of
Hercules, including dynamic reconfiguration, integrated console,
interpretive execution and z/Architecture support.

Until shortly after the Turbo-Hercules debacle, a dedicated crew of
programmers was constantly at work implementing new features and fixing
bugs. It is questionable whether the same is true today. Thus the reason
for the existence of this SoftDevLabs version of Hercules 4.0 Hyperion:
to try and keep the Hercules project alive and active. (Sadly, there's not
a lot of activity these days with the original version of Hercules.)

Currently, I (David B. Trout) am the only one making changes to this
particular version of Hercules, but there are a few others that do
occassionally help out by submitting patches and pull requests. I wish
there were more! It's more work than one person can handle!
