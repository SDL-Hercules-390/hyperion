This directory contains a couple of updates to VM370CE that
go along with the Print/Punch File Handshake modification
to Hercules. Specifically, when these updates are applied
to the CP component of VM370CE v1.1.2, you will be able to
utilize the new Hercules "handshake" option for printer and 
punch devices.

There are two updates that need to be applied to CP:

* WED002DK - allows program control of Command-Reject error
             handling. The next update uses this to prevent
             I/O errors being posted when the Hercules
             "handshake" option is not in force.

* WED003DK - updates the spooled print/punch processing to
             utilize the new File-Open/Close CCWs to create
             individual native files for each VM spool file.
