<h2>Release notes for SDL Hyperion 4.2 <small> &nbsp; (under development) </small></h2>
<p>
<dl>


  <dt>CCKD64 Support
  <dd>
  <p>
    Version 4.2 of SDL Hercules Hyperion introduces support for very large
    Compressed CKD (CCKD) dasd image files, called <b>CCKD64</b>, which can
    be much larger than 4GB in size.  More information about <b>CCKD64</b>
    can be found in the
    <a href="https://github.com/SDL-Hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.CCKD64">README.CCKD64</a>
    document in the source code distribution.  Detailed CCKD64 <i>file format</i>
    information can be found on the
    "<a href="cckddasd.html">Compressed Dasd Emulation</a>"
    web page.
  </p>


  <dt>SIGABEND Machine Check handler on Linux builds replaced with Crash handler
  <dd>
  <p>
    The original designed "SIGABEND" handler on Linux builds that intercepted Hercules
    abends (e.g. SIGSEGV, i.e. Hercules crashes, etc) and presented a Machine Check
    Interruption to the guest in an attempt to allow Hercules and the guest to continue
    running (in the hope that the guest would be able to either recover from the Machine
    Check or be able to gracefully shutdown) has been removed since it served no valid
    purpose other than to hide/mask otherwise very serious bugs in the Hercules emulator
    making it nearly impossible to find or fix them.
    <p>
    Now, if Hercules crashes (due to a SIGSEGV, etc), the guest is no longer notified
    of the event (a Machine Check Interruption does not occur) and Hercules makes no
    attempt to recover or otherwise continue. Instead, it attempts to issue a message
    to the Hercules user informing them of the crash and then requests that the host
    perform default handling of the event (which is usually to create a "core" dump file
    which can then be analyzed by gdb or by some other means to determine the cause of
    the crash).
    <p>
    For more information regarding Linux core files, such as how to enable their creation
    and how to analyze them when they occur, please refer to the following GitHub Issue:
    <i>"<a href="https://github.com/SDL-Hercules-390/hyperion/issues/199">How to analyze
    a Linux "core" file (i.e. crash dump)</a>"</i> (#199).
  </p>


  <dt>Integrated Regina REXX support no longer provided by default
  <dd>
  <p>
    For those who want integrated Regina rexx support in Hercules, you will
    now have to explicitly request such support on your <code>./configure</code>
    command by specifying the <code>'--enable-regina-rexx'</code> option.  For
    everyone else, integrated support for Regina rexx will <i>no longer</i> be
    automatically provided by Hercules, even if it is installed in their system.
    <p>
    In other words, you can still have Regina rexx installed on your system
    and use it as you normally would, but simply having it installed on your
    system will now <i>no longer</i> cause Hercules to also provide integrated
    support for it.
    <p>
    For more information refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/SDL-Hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.REXX">README.REXX</a>
    document in the source code distribution.
  </p>


  <dt>Partial implementation of PFPO (Perform Floating Point Operation) instruction
  <dd>
  <p>
    Thanks to a recent contribution by one of our users, Hercules now has a partial
    implementation of the PFPO (Perform Floating Point Operation) instruction.
    (Previously we had no implementation at all.)
    <p>
    The current implementation is only a partial implementation and does not yet fully
    conform to the Principles of Operation, but it is better than what we had (which
    was nothing). Efforts are currently under way to finish the current implementation
    to make it fully compliant to the published architecture, but the effort has not
    been completed yet, so it might not execute properly under certain situations.
    Hopefully it should execute well enough under most common situations however.
  </p>


  <dt>VMFPLC2 VM/CMS tape utility enhanced
  <dd>
  <p>
    The VMFPLC2 tape utility has been greatly enhanced and now supports the scan
    and load functions, making it much easier to transfer files between the host
    system and z/VM or VM/370 systems. Refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/SDL-Hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.VMFPLC2">README.VMFPLC2</a>
    document for usage details.
  </p>


  <dt>System/370/390 Vector Facility has been disabled again
  <dd>
  <p>
    It was a mistake to enable the System/370 and System/390 Vector Facility
    set of instructions in release 4.1.  Hercules's implementation of the
    facility only implements 26 of the required 180 instructions the facility
    provides and thus is so incredibly incomplete as to be virtually unusable.
    <p>
    Given that virtually no one has ever complained about its unavailability
    beforehand (and the interference it causes internally with the desired
    proper functioning of the Hercules S/370 Extension pseudo-facility), it has
    once again been disabled.
    <p>
    This is very likely to be a permanent setting given the extreme unlikelihood
    of the facility ever being fully coded due to its unpopularity and the extreme
    challenges posed by trying to code all of the missing instructions for a fully
    compliant facility.
  </p>


  <dt>TCPIP (X'75') instruction integrated
  <dd>
  <p>
    This instruction was developed by Jason Winter to allow the guest OS access
    to the IP stack of the host OS. It is of particular importance to older
    operating systems that do not support their own IP stack. It provides full
    IPv4 networking capabilities to those systems.
    <p>
    Note that the TCPIP instruction doesn't fully comply with IBM's S/3x0, ESA/390
    or z/Architecture specifications. For this reason it is not enabled by default.
    File
    <a href="https://github.com/SDL-Hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.TCPIP">README.TCPIP</a>
    provides the information needed to enable the instruction.
  </p>


  <dt>Breakpoint/Stepping commands optional ASID parameter
  <dd>
  <p>
    The <code>b</code> (breakpoint) and <code>s</code> (stepping) commands
    now support an optional <b><code>asid</code></b> (<b>A</b>ddress <b>S</b>pace
    <b>ID</b>entifier) parameter. If specified, the breakpoint or stepping
    will only occur if the instruction being executed is <i>both</i> within
    the specified address range <i><u>and</u></i> are being executed by the
    specified address space. The breakpoint or stepping will <i>not</i>
    occur for any other address spaces even if they are within the specified
    address range.
    <p>
    For more information refer to the <code>help</code> command display
    for the <code>b</code> and/or <code>s</code> commands.
  </p>

<h2>Release notes for <a href="https://github.com/SDL-Hercules-390/hyperion/releases">SDL Hyperion 4.1</a></h2>
<p>
<dl>


  <dt>External Packages
  <dd>
  <p>
    Select source code and associated functionality has been moved out of
    the Hercules repository and into separately maintained External Package
    repositories.  Refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/sdl-hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.EXTPKG">README.EXTPKG</a>
    document for more information.
  </p>


  <dt>Minimum supported Windows platform is now Windows Vista
  <dd>
  <p>
    The new minimum supported Windows platform is now Windows Vista.  All
    Hercules users still running older versions of Windows should upgrade
    to at least Windows Vista or greater, with Windows 7 being preferred.
  </p>


  <dt>The ability to define process and thread priorities has been removed
  <dd>
  <p>
    Previously, Hercules supported various commands/statements that allowed the
    tweaking of Hercules's various internal thread priorities (HERCPRIO, CPUPRIO,
    TODPRIO, etc). This ability has been removed. Such statements in your
    configuration file will now cause a "deprecated and ignored" warning message
    instead. You should remove all such statements from your configuration file.
  </p>


  <dt>ARCHLVL and FACILITY command changes
  <dd>
  <p>
    The <code><a href="hercconf.html#FACILITY">FACILITY</a></code> command was completely
    redesigned and rewritten in order to more properly support and enforce the concept
    of prerequisite facilities (i.e. a facility presuming/requiring some other facility).
    As part of this rewrite the ARCHLVL command functionality to enable/disable/query
    facilities was moved into a new separate FACILITY command such that the ARCHLVL command
    now only deals with setting/querying the architecture mode. To enable/disable/query
    facilities, use the new FACILITY command.
    <p>
    Additionally, the facility names used in the <code>FACILITY </code> command to
    enable, disable or query a facility have also been changed. All defined facilities
    now begin with a 3-digit facility bit number in addition to their abbreviated
    facility name. This was done to ensure the correct facility was being enabled or
    disabled due to the similarity of some facility names. For example, the previously
    named "ASN_LX_REUSE" facility is now named "006_ASN_LX_REUSE".  Similarly, the
    previously named "PFPO" facility is now named "044_PFPO".
    <p>
    For a detailed list of the new abbreviated (short) facility names,
    use the "<code>FACILITY QUERY ...</code>" command.
  </p>


  <dt>"ASN and LX Reuse" now defaults to enabled for z/Architecture
  <dd>
  <p>
    The "ASN and LX Reuse" facility (STFL bit 6) is now enabled by default
    for the z/Architecture mode, as it should have been all along.  It is
    still disabled by default for the ESA/390 architecture mode however.
    <p>
    In earlier versions of Hercules it defaulted to disabled requiring those
    running z/Architecture guest operating systems to have to manually add
    an <code>FACILITY ENABLE 006_ASN_LX_REUSE</code> statement to their
    configuration file. Such statements are now no longer necessary.
  </p>


  <dt>MAXCPU and NUMCPU statements
  <dd>
  <p>
    The combination of <a href="hercconf.html#NUMCPU">NUMCPU</a> and
    <a href="hercconf.html#MAXCPU">MAXCPU</a> controls the behavior of how many
    CPU engines will be configured online upon startup and how many can be
    configured online later. In previous versions this was controlled via
    the NUMCPU statement and the compile-time constant 'MAX_CPU_ENGINES'.
    <p>
    For compatibility with previous versions of Hercules, if MAXCPU is
    not specified its value defaults to NUMCPU. If neither is specified
    it defaults to 1.
  </p>


  <dt>HTTPROOT and HTTPPORT statements are now fully deprecated
  <dd>
  <p>
    Any <code>httproot</code> or <code>httpport</code> statements are now
    rejected as invalid statements. All users still using either statement
    format in their configuration files must now replace all occurrences
    with <code>http root ...</code> and <code>http port ...</code> instead.
  </p>


  <dt>New and improved CMPSC Compression Call 2012 instruction implementation is now the default
  <dd>
  <p>
    The default implementation for the CMPSC Compression Call instruction
    is now the new cmpsc_2012 implementation. The previous legacy implementation
    no longer exists. Refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/sdl-hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.CMPSC">README.CMPSC</a>
    document of the source code distribution for more information.
  </p>


  <dt>The sequence of certain configuration file statements is important
  <dd>
  <p>
    The <code><a href="hercconf.html#ARCHLVL">ARCHLVL</a></code>
    statement (previously called <code>ARCHMODE</code> for example, defines
    the initial architectural mode of the system) should generally <i>precede</i>
    (come before) any <code>FACILITY</code> statements that enable or disable
    a given architectural feature.
    <p>
    For example: on certain IBM operating systems the z/Architecture "PFPO
    Facility" must be enabled or the system will not IPL. While at the time
    of this writing Hercules does not currently support the Perform Floating-Point
    Operation (PFPO) Facility, the STFLE facility bit can nonetheless be
    forcibly enabled anyway via the
    <code><a href="hercconf.html#FACILITY">FACILITY ENABLE BIT44</a></code>
    configuration file statement. Since the facility is a z/Architecture-only
    feature however, your initial architecture must either be set to "z/Arch"
    beforehand, or else you need to specify the optional
    <code><em>[archlvl]</em></code> parameter on your FACILITY ENABLE BIT44 statement.
    This usually means your "<code>ARCHLVL z/Arch</code>" statement must come
    <i>before</i> your "<code>FACILITY ENABLE BIT44</code>" statement in your
    configuration file. Otherwise the PFPO Facility would not get enabled.
    <p>
    With the introduction of limited automatic LPAR-mode/BASIC-mode switching
    (see next item below), <code><a href="hercconf.html#LPARNUM">LPARNUM</a></code>
    statements should follow <code><a href="hercconf.html#ARCHLVL">ARCHLVL</a></code>
    statements if LPAR mode is truly desired for <code>ARCHLVL S/370</code>
    (which is usually not the case).
    <p>
    The <code>ARCHLVL</code> and <code>LPARNUM</code> statements are currently
    the only known configuration file statements whose sequence matters. The
    order of all other configuration file statements should not currently matter.
    This may change in the future however, so be sure to always carefully read
    through the RELEASE NOTES (this document) with each new update to Hercules.
  </p>


  <dt>Limited automatic LPARNUM updating when setting certain architecture modes
  <dd>
  <p>
    When <code><a href="hercconf.html#ARCHLVL">ARCHLVL S/370</a></code> is set,
    <code><a href="hercconf.html#LPARNUM">LPARNUM</a></code> is now automatically
    changed to <code>BASIC</code> (which also changes
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUIDFMT">CPUIDFMT</a> to <code>BASIC</code> as well),
    and when <code>ARCHLVL z/Arch</code> is set, it is then changed back to the
    default <code>LPARNUM 1</code> again (which also automatically changes the
    <code>CPUIDFMT</code> back to <code>0</code> as well), but only when needed.
    <p>
    That is to say, the automatic switching to and from <code>LPARNUM BASIC</code>
    (and <code>CPUIDFMT BASIC</code>) and <code>LPARNUM 1</code>
    (and <code>CPUIDFMT 0</code>) only occurs when needed (and only when switching
    between S/370 and z/Arch). If <code>LPARNUM</code> (and
    <code>CPUIDFMT</code>) are already set to the expected values they will not
    be changed. When <code>ARCHLVL ESA/390</code> is set however, <code>LPARNUM</code>
    and <code>CPUIDFMT</code> are never changed from their current values.
    <p>
    This new behavior was introduced to eliminate the "surprise" factor that would
    otherwise occur when, if the <code>LPARNUM</code> remained set to <code>1</code>
    (or some other number), not doing so causes the STIDP (Store CPU ID) instruction
    to be stored in an otherwise unexpected format. In most all situations when
    a Hercules user sets <code>ARCHLVL S/370</code>, they are truly expecting the
    <code>LPARNUM</code> and <code>CPUIDFMT</code> to be set to <code>BASIC</code>
    such that the STIDP instruction then stores the CPU ID in the expected format.
    <p>
    For the unusual case where users actually <i>do</i> want to run a System/370
    Operating System within an LPAR, you will need to manually re-set your
    <code>LPARNUM</code> and <code>CPUIDFMT</code> values back to their numeric
    values <i><u>after</u></i> setting <code>ARCHLVL S/370</code>. That is to say,
    one should always follow their <code>ARCHLVL S/370</code> statement with a
    <code>LPARNUM n&#124;nn</code> statement (and <code>CPUIDFMT</code> statement
    too if needed) if LPAR mode for S/370 is truly desired.
  </p>


  <dt>More architecturally compliant Channel Subsystem implementation
  <dd>
  <p>
    Hercules 4.x Hyperion's channel subsystem implementation now more closely
    adheres to published and unpublished architectural specifications. It does
    not precisely adhere to the complete specification but it does adhere much
    more closely than ever before (and definitely more closely than the legacy
    implementation still used in the older spinhawk 3.xx series of Hercules).
    <p>
    If you experience any anomalies in the behavior of your guest operating
    system, verify that you are using architecurally valid/correct configuration
    settings that your guest operating system expects.
    <p>
    Pay <i><u>particular</u></i> attention to your
    <a href="hercconf.html#ARCHLVL">ARCHLVL</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#LPARNUM">LPARNUM</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUIDFMT">CPUIDFMT</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUMODEL">CPUMODEL</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUSERIAL">CPUSERIAL</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUVERID">CPUVERID</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#MODEL">MODEL</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#PLANT">PLANT</a>
    and
    <a href="hercconf.html#MANUFACTURER">MANUFACTURER</a>
    values since they typically have a direct impact on how
    certain guest operating systems behave.
  </p>


  <dt>Configuration file statements and panel commands handled identically
  <dd>
  <p>
    Most configuration file statements are now available as and processed as
    panel commands. Most valid configuration file statements may now also be
    entered as a panel command. Most panel commands are now also allowed as
    configuration file statements. See the documentation for full details.
  </p>


  <dt>Improved ECPSVM Support
  <dd>
  <p>
    Hyperion 4.x now provides a mostly complete ECPSVM CP/VM Assist
    implementation. While still not 100% complete, support for many new
    assists has been added and several bugs have been fixed. Refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/sdl-hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.ECPSVM">README.ECPSVM</a>
    document for more detailed information.
  </p>


  <dt>Integrated Rexx support
  <dd>
  <p>
    Rexx support was first added to Hercules by Jan Jaeger in 2010
    and has been gradually enhanced over the years by both Enrico Sorichetti
    and Jan Jaeger as well as a few other people too.
    <p>
    If you have <a href="http://www.rexxla.org">Rexx</a> installed on your
    host and Hercules is built with the Rexx build option (the default for
    the SDL version of Hyperion), then Rexx scripts
    can be run directly from within the Hercules environment (i.e. directly
    from the Hercules HMC command line via the Hercules <code>exec</code> command).
    <p>
    Rexx scripts, when run within Hercules via the 'exec' command, can
    Address the HERCULES enviroment allowing you to issue Hercules commands
    and retrieve the results via the builtin 'AWSCMD' Rexx function call.
    <p>
    For more information please refer to the new
    <a href="rexx.html">Hercules Integrated Rexx Support</a> web page.
  </p>


  <dt>SHCMDOPT defaults change
  <dd>
  <p>
    The defaults for the <a href="hercconf.html#SHCMDOPT">SHCMDOPT</a> have changed.
    The old defaults were <code>ENABLE DIAG8</code>.
    The new defaults are <code>DISABLE NODIAG8</code>.
    This was done for security reasons.
  </p>


  <dt>SHCMDOPT option also controls Rexx EXEC command
  <dd>
  <p>
    The <code>ENABLE</code> and <code>DISABLE</code> option of the
    <a href="hercconf.html#SHCMDOPT">SHCMDOPT</a> command now also controls
    the Rexx <code>exec</code> command as well as the <code>sh</code> command.
    That is to say, the Rexx <code>exec</code> command is now properly treated
    as a host shell command. Thus, enabling or disabling the execution of host
    shell commands via the <a href="hercconf.html#SHCMDOPT">SHCMDOPT</a> option
    now also enables or disables execution of the <code>exec</code> command as well.
    This was done for security reasons.
  </p>


  <dt>Change to DIAG8CMD ECHO behavior
  <dd>
  <p>
    The behavior of the <a href="hercconf.html#DIAG8CMD">DIAG8CMD</a> command's
    <code>ECHO</code> and <code>NOECHO</code> options has changed. Previosuly
    the echo/noecho option had a a direct impact on the data that was placed into
    the Diagnose 8 instruction's response buffer. This has been fixed so that now
    it does not.
    <p>
    Previously, specifying the ECHO option caused audit trail messages HHC01950I
    and HHC01603I to also appear in the instruction's response buffer, whereas now
    only the command's actual output is placed into the response buffer. The ECHO
    option now properly controls <i><u>only</u></i> the issuing of the HHC01950I
    and HHC01603I audit messages to both the panel and hardcopy logfile,
    but does not otherwise impact in any way what is placed into the instruction's
    response buffer, as was the original intent for this option.
  </p>


  <dt>3088, CTCI-W32, CTCT and VMNET support dropped
  <dd>
  <p>
    Support for 3088, CTCI-W32, CTCT and VMNET devices has been dropped.
    3088 Channel-To-Channel Adapter support (which was the original intent
    of CTCT) has instead been replaced with Peter Jansen's vastly improved
    Enhanced Channel-To-Channel (<a href="hercconf.html#CTCE">CTCE</a>) device
    support, which provides true Extended mode Channel-To-Channel Adapter
    capabilities, allowing you to use
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Resource_Serialization">GRS</a>
    to connect multiple Hercules instances together in a type of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Parallel_Sysplex">Sysplex</a>.
  </p>


  <dt>CAPPING support removed
  <dd>
  <p>
    Previous versions of Hercules supported a "CAPPING" configuration statement
    designed to purposely reduce performance to ensure that your MIPS rate never
    exceeded the specified value. This functionality has now been removed.
  </p>


  <dt>New NETDEV configuration file statement
  <dd>
  <p>
    A new <code>NETDEV</code> configuration file statement is now supported
    to allow you to specify which host network adapter should be used by default
    for Hercules communications devices. It only represents a default and can be
    overridden on the device statements themselves. Refer to the documentation
    for the "<code><a href="hercconf.html#NETDEV">NETDEV</a></code>" statement
    for more information.
  </p>


  <dt>New "t+-" Automatic Tracing command
  <dd>
  <p>
    A new "<code>t+-</code>" (tee-plus-minus) Automatic Tracing command has been
    created that may prove to be helpful in capturing guest issues that occur
    very early in the guest's IPL sequence. Refer to the "<code>help t+-</code>"
    help display for more information.
  </p>


  <dt>Default tape AUTOINIT option is now ON (enabled)
  <dd>
  <p>
    The <code><a href="hercconf.html#AUTOINIT">AUTOINIT</a></code> option
    controls whether device files for emulated tape volumes should be
    automatically created or not if they do not exist. The previous default
    was <code>OFF</code>. The new default is <code><u>ON</u></code>.
  </p>


  <dt>Diagnose X'F14' support removed
  <dd>
  <p>
    Hercules's Diagnose X'F14' functionality was designed to allow
    a Hercules guest to call into any host system DLL (Dynamic Link
    Library). Since its use (dubius to begin with) was determined to be
    a potential security risk (and the code didn't appear to be used
    anywhere anyway), support for it was removed.
  </p>


  <dt>System/370/390 Vector Facility instructions are now enabled by default
  <dd>
  <p>
    Hercules has always supported the System/370 and System/390 Vector Facility
    set of instructions but support for them was never enabled by default. This
    has now been corrected.
  </p>


  <dt>Hercules S/370 Instruction Extension Facility
  <dd>
  <p>
    A new Hercules S/370 Instruction Extension Facility has been implemented to
    replace the functionality previously provided by the "s37x.dll" dynamically
    loadable module. Please refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/sdl-hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.S37X">README.S37X</a>
    document for more information.

<h2>Release notes for release 3.06</h2>
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>Tape "AUTOMOUNT" support
  <dd>
  <p>
    Starting with Hercules version 3.06 a new AUTOMOUNT option is available
    that allows guest operating systems to directly mount, unmount and query
    tape device filenames for themselves, without any intervention on the
    part of the Hercules operator.
    </p><p>
    Automount support is enabled via the AUTOMOUNT configuration file statement.
    </p><p>
    An example guest automount program for VSE called "TMOUNT" is provided in
    the util subdirectory of the Hercules source code distribution.
    </p><p>
    Briefly, the 0x4B (Set Diagnose) CCW is used to mount (or unmount) a file
    onto a tape drive, and the 0xE4 (Sense Id) CCW opcode is used to query the
    name of the currently mounted file.
    </p><p>
    For mounts, the 0x4B CCW specifies the filename of the file to be mounted
    onto the drive. The file MUST reside in the specified AUTOMOUNT directory
    or the automount request will be rejected. To unmount the currently mounted
    file, simply do a mount of the special filename "OFFLINE".
    </p><p>
    To query the name of the currently mounted file, the 0xE4 CCW is used. Note
    however that the 0xE4 (Sense Id) CCW opcode cannot be used by itself since
    the drive may also already natively support the Sense Id CCW opcode. Instead,
    it must be preceded by (command-chained from) a 0x4B CCW with a data transfer
    length of one byte. The following 0xE4 command is the one that then specifies
    the i/o buffer and buffer length of where the query function is to place the
    device's currently mounted host filename.
    </p><p>
    In summary:
    </p><pre>
        MOUNT:      X'4B', filename, X'20', length

        UNMOUNT:    (same thing but use filename "OFFLINE" instead)

        QUERY:      X'4B', buffer, X'60', 1
                    X'E4', buffer, X'20', buffersize</pre>
    <p>
    Again please refer to the provided TMOUNT program for a simple example
    of how automount support might be implmented on a guest operating system.

<h2>Release notes for release 3.05</h2>
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>Use 'startgui' if starting GUI program via 'sh' command
  <dd>
  <p>
    The 'conspawn' utility used to process 'sh' commands now recognizes a
    specially designed keyword "startgui" to accomodate automatic starting
    of Windows GUI applications via the .RC file or panel command-line.
    </p><p>
    If the first word following 'sh' is "startgui", then the "ShellExecute"
    API is used to start the requested program rather than the 'system()'
    API as otherwise.
    </p><p>
    The "startgui" keyword must always be used to start any Windows program
    that is not a command-line program. Hercules, itself being a command-line
    program, monitors the 'stderr' and 'stdout' pipes so it can log messages
    received from either pipe directly to the Hercules console log. Programs
    such as notepad however, because they are not command-line programs, do
    not use stdout/stderr thus causing Hercules to hang if "start" is used
    instead.
    </p><p>
    This rule applies regardless of how Hercules itself is started (i.e. via
    HercGUI or directly via the command-line) and regardless of whether the
    "start" command is wrapped in a batch file or not. That is to say, using
    the Hercules command "sh batchfile foobar" to start your batch file which
    then does "start notepad %1" still causes Hercules to hang until notepad
    first exits. Instead, you should ask Hercules to "sh startgui batchfile",
    and let the batchfile start notepad however it wants.
  </p>

  <dt>Real SCSI tape drive support
  <dd>
  <p>
    Real SCSI tape drives used with Hercules must provide a certain minimum set
    is "IBM compatible" support in their SCSI command set/behavior in order to
    work properly with Hercules. Furthermore, the Hercules device-type used on
    your device statement in your Hercules configuration file should match the
    the level of support/behavior that they provide.
    </p><p>
    For example, all SCSI tape drives used with Hercules must provide the ability
    to set variable-length blocks as well as long erase-gaps (long erase-gaps
    allows new data to be appended to the end of existing data without having to
    write a tape-mark to separate the new data from the old existing data first).
    </p><p>
    Another example would be using a model of SCSI tape drive that happens to
    report physical block-id values in a format different from the way real IBM
    mainframe tape drives report them. 3480/3490 tape drives for example report
    their block-ids (used in Read Block Id and Locate CCWs) in a very specific
    format wherein bits 1-7 of the high-order byte of the reported 4-byte block-
    id indicates the tape's physical "segment" location of where the lower 22-
    bit block number is physically located on the tape. (The block-id segment
    is used to allow the tape drive to quickly position itself to the approximate
    location where the desired block acually resides on the tape and thus allows
    high-speed positioning for the Locate CCW).
    </p><p>
    If the model of SCSI tape drive you are actually using with Hercules does not
    use this same block-id format however, then it cannot be used with Hercules
    as a 3480 or 3490 model tape drive with specially defined options.
    </p><p>
    If the SCSI tape drive you are using reports its block-ids using a 32-bit
    block-id value (the same way a 3590 model tape drive does), then similarly,
    it should be defined to Hercules as a model 3590 device-type as well (since
    that is how it is behaving with respect the format of the returned blockid
    values). It you wish to define it in Hercules as a model 3480 or 3490, then
    you will need to use specially defined options before it will work properly
    as the model drive you wish it to emulate.
    </p><p>
    With all that being said, it should be noted that PARTIAL support for 3590
    device emulation is possible with judicious use the aforementioned special
    options, but full/complete 3590 support is unlikely due to lack of publicly
    available documentation. Details regarding 3590 CCW handling is restricted
    (confidential) IBM proprietary information, and is not normally available
    outside of IBM. Not long ago IBM was required by US law to publish such
    information, but unfortunately for Hercules, such is no longer the case.
    </p><p>
    For further information regarding use of SCSI attached tape drives with
    Hercules and their associated specially defined options, please refer to
    the section on SCSI tape drives in the Hercules's Device Configuration
    documentation.

  <dt>Internal thread priorities changed on Windows for platform consistency
  <dd>
  <p>
    In order to ensure proper functioning of the TOD clock with older versions
    of guest operating systems, the default values of Hercules's internal thread
    priorities for the Windows version of Hercules were changed to be identical
    to those used by all other supported platforms. Originally, the default
    thread priority values for the Windows version of Hercules were:
    </p><pre>
              ***  3.04 (and prior) Default Priorities  ***

              Thread    Priority           Meaning
              -------   --------   ------------------------
              HERCPRIO     0        Normal Process priority

              DEVPRIO     -8        Above Normal  Thread priority
              TODPRIO      0        Normal        Thread priority
              CPUPRIO      0        Normal        Thread priority</pre>
    <p>
    which caused acceptable performance/functioning on most, but not all, guest
    operating systems. Beginning with version 3.05 however, the prioriries now
    default to:
    </p><pre>
              ***  3.05 (and later) Default  Priorities  ***

              Thread    Priority           Meaning
              -------   --------   ------------------------
              HERCPRIO     0        Normal Process priority

              TODPRIO    -20        Time Critical  Thread priority
              DEVPRIO      8        Below Normal   Thread priority
              CPUPRIO     15        Lowest         Thread priority</pre>
    <p>
    which may on more modern guest operating systems (which handle the TOD clock
    differently than do older less sophticated versions) cause a slight decrease
    in overall performance. If such is the case, the original default priorities
    (and thus the original behavior) can be obtained via addition of appropriate
    HERCPRIO, TODPRIO, DEVPRIO and CPUPRIO control file statements with values
    identical to the original version 3.04 default values.
  </p>

  <dt>Configuration file usability enhancements and Automatic Operator facility
  <dd>
  <p>
    Additional configuration file usability enhancements have been implemented
    in the form of a new 'INCLUDE' (and associated 'IGNORE') statement, allowing
    configuration files to "include" statements from a different named file.
    </p><p>
    Additonally, a new "enhanced" symbolic substitution syntax is now also
    supported. Refer to the Hercules "Configuration File" documentation for
    further information and details.
    </p><p>
    A rather nifty "Automatic Operator" facility has also been implemented in
    the current release as well. While not exactly a "configuration file
    usability enhancement", it is nevertheless something we hope might prove
    to be more useful/helpful to our many users. See the "README.HAO" document
    for more information.

<h2>Release notes for release 3.02</h2>
<p>Release date: 11 December 2004
<dl>
<dt>ASN-and-LX-reuse facility
<dd>
<p>This is a new feature of z/Architecture which can cause problems with
certain versions of operating systems running in ARCHLVL=2 mode without
the so-called "Driver 55" fixes. To avoid such problems, specify
<code>ASN_AND_LX_REUSE DISABLE</code> in the configuration file. </p>
</dl>

<hr>
<h2>Release notes for release 3.01</h2>
<p>Release date: 30 November 2003
<dl>
<dt>Library modules and HTTP documents default directories
<dd><p>
An error in the 3.00 configuration script caused many users to have to
override the default modules and HTTP documents directory in the
Hercules configuration file, or by setting an environment variable. This
error has been corrected. Hercules also now reports the actual directory
that it uses by default for these files at startup time. If you specified
the MODPATH or HTTPROOT configuration file statements because you
encountered problems, you should examine the messages printed at startup to
see if the default directories are now correct, and remove the statements
if so.</p>
<p>In general, MODPATH and HTTPROOT should not have to be specified
except in unusual circumstances.</p>
<dt>Windows default directories
<dd>
<p>In conjunction with the fix above, the default directories of the
Windows distributed binaries have been changed. The new directories are
under C:\cygwin\usr\local (which is the same as /usr/local under the Cygwin
environment). No action is needed unless you have specified the MODPATH or
HTTPROOT configuration file entries; if so, see the previous note.</p>
<dt>Message Security Assist
<dd>
<p>Support for z990 crypto instructions is conditional on the presence of the
glibcrypt library.
When Hercules is BUILT, the development files for glibcrypt should be available.
When hercules is RUN, the runtime files for glibcrypt should be installed.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of glibcrypt used to *build* hercules, the associated
level of glibcrypt should also be present on the target machine. On systems
supporting shared library versioning, multiple levels of the glibcrypt
runtime libraries can be installed simultaneously, ensuring availability
of the z990 crypto instructions, regardless of the level of glibcrypt with
which hercules was initially built.</p>
<dt>CTC and LCS device numbers
<dd>
<p>CTC and LCS devices now <i>MUST</i> specify ALL addresses on the configuration
statement.
Previously (i.e. with version 3.00), only the first (even numbered) device
needed to be defined and Hercules would automatically define the odd numbered
device for you. Starting with Hercules version 3.01 however, you now need
to define BOTH devices, just like you did with versions prior to 3.00.
Once again, starting with version 3.01, you **MUST** define BOTH DEVICES.</p>
</dl>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<hr>
<h2>Release notes for release 3.00</h2>
<p>Release date: 3 October 2003
<dl>
<dt>CTCI device changes
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The CTCI-W32 protocol is deprecated. You should use the CTCI
protocol instead.</li>
<li>The VMNET protocol is also deprecated. Not even its author uses it any
more. Every system on which Hercules is now prebuilt has the TUN/TAP
driver functionality available in one form or another, and it's much more
robust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will go away in a future release.</p>
<p>In addition, you <b>must not</b> define both even/odd CTCI device pairs in
your configuration file. You should <b>only</b> define the first even
numbered device. Hercules will automatically define the odd numbered device
for you. If you define the odd numbered device by mistake, an open error will
occur on that device. This is by design. See the README.NETWORKING document
for further details.</p>
<dt>Hercules Dynamic Loader support
<dd>
<p>Starting with version 3.00, Hercules now contains support for the dynamic
loading of certain modules upon startup on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
This support should also work on any platform supported by GNU libtool. As a
result of this new feature, Hercules itself now no longer consists of just the
'hercules.exe' module by itself, but rather consists of both the 'hercules.exe'
program as well as whatever dynamic modules (DLLs) that accompany it.</p>
<p>As a result of this change, whenever you install a new version of Hercules,
you must ensure that you ALSO install the accompanying new versions of the
new dynamic modules as well. Attempting to use a version of Hercules with a
dynamic module that was not specifically built for that version will cause
loading of that dynamic module to fail.</p>
<p>You <b>cannot</b> mix versions of Hercules with differing versions of
dynamically loaded modules.</p>
<p>Ensure that your library path (set by the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH) set correctly such that it includes the directory of your
Hercules dynamic load libraries. If you see message <code>HHCCF042E</code>,
which indicates that the system is unable to locate necessary loadable
modules, this is likely your problem. This should not be necessary if you
have a binary download, but if you're building from source, especially if
you've previously installed a binary package, this should be the first thing
you do.</p>
<dt>ECPS:VM
<dd>
<p>Do not use ECPS:VM (See README.ECPSVM) in an AP or MP environment
in VM/370. If <code>AP=YES</code> or <code>MP=YES</code> is coded in DMKSYS
and the AP/MP control file is used to build the CP nucleus and
<code>NUMCPU</code> is set to more than 1 in the <code>hercules.cnf</code>
file, any of LOK001, LOK003 or other abends will occur. This occurs because
the Hercules ECPS:VM CP Assist implementation is not MP safe, and
particularly, attempts VM dispatching without holding necessary AP or MP
locks.</p>
<dt>Memory allocation on Windows
<dd>
<p>Due to the change in the "mainstor" memory allocation technique used by Hercules to
address a "double memory consumption" bug in Cygwin's malloc implementation,
some Windows Hercules users may experience an "out of memory" error whenever
Hercules is started with a large <code>MAINSIZE</code> configuration file
value:</p>
<p><code>HHCCF031S Cannot obtain nnnMB main storage</code></p>
<p>This error will most likely occur (if it does at all) for those users who
have manually adjusted their Cygwin <code>heap_chunk_in_mb</code> Windows
registry setting value (in order to allow them to specify a large
<code>MAINSIZE</code> value when running Hercules). If this problem does occur
(i.e. if you <b>do</b> happen to experience the above mentioned error with
this new release of Hercules), then either reduce your
<code>heap_chunk_in_mb</code> value (yes, that's correct: <b>reduce</b> it,
as in change it to a <b>smaller</b> value) or else remove it altogether (so
as to let it default).</p>
<p>A complete discussion of this issue is in the RELEASE.NOTES file
in the source distribution.</p>
<dt>Thread priority and other problems
<dd>
<p>There is a known problem with thread priority handling under Mac OS
X. The OS X threading model is different from the one classically used in
Linux. This causes failures to set the timer thread priority, and slow
performance as all of Hercules is set to a low execution priority. This
will be fixed in a future release. A workaround, for now, for slow
performance is to add the statement</p>
<p><code>CPUPRIO 0</code></p>
<p>to your Hercules configuration file.</p>
<p>A possibly related problem is that Hercules fails in random ways when
using the NPTL (new POSIX threads library) library under Linux.
This library is used by default in Red Hat 9, and possibly other systems.
If problems are encountered on a very recent version of Linux, try issuing
the command</p>
<p><code>export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1</code></p>
<p>before starting Hercules.</p>
