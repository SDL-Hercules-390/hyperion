    What is Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Hercules is a software implementation of the System/370, ESA/390 and
    z/Architecture mainframe architectures. Hercules runs under Windows
    and Linux, as well as under various other Unix or Unix-like systems
    on Intel Pentium and other hardware platforms including Alpha,
    Sparc, and Mac.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.02">1.02</A>
    So what exactly does that mean?
</H4>
<P>
    It means that your PC can emulate an IBM mainframe processor. The
    mainframe can range from a System/360 to a z10 - running in "S/370"
    mode, "ESA/390" mode, or "z/Architecture" mode.
</P>
<P>
    Hercules executes S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture instructions
    and channel programs.  It emulates mainframe I/O devices by using
    PC devices.  For example, 3390 DASD devices are emulated by large
    files on your hard disk, and local 3270 screens are emulated by tn3270
    sessions. (Note: Not all 370 and 390 features have been implemented
    in Hercules. See the list of particulars later in this document.
    Also, certain non-standard models, 360/20s, and the 360/67 virtual
    memory mode are not emulated.)
</P>
<P>
    Hercules implements only the raw S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture
    instruction set; it does not provide any operating system facilities.
    This means that you need to provide an operating system or standalone
    program which Hercules can load from an emulated disk or tape device.
    You will have to write the operating system or standalone program
    yourself, unless you can manage to obtain a license from IBM to run
    one of their operating systems on your PC, or use IBM programs and
    operating systems which have been placed in the public domain.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.03">1.03</A>
    Is it functional enough to run production work?
</H4>
<P>
    Hercules has never claimed to be a production-capable system.
    It was always meant to be a system programmer's toy. Having said
    that, it's now become good enough to run a wide range of software
    without problems, and there are reports that it has been used to
    run production work in some parts of the world.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.04">1.04</A>
    What are the licensing restrictions for Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Hercules is a copyright work which has been made generally
    available, subject to the terms of the
<A HREF="herclic.html">Q Public License</A>.
    In essence this allows free use and distribution of the program for
    personal and commercial use.  You may not distribute modified copies
    of the program, but you may distribute your own patches along with
    the program, provided that you also grant the maintainer permission
    to include those patches in future versions of the program.  You may
    not copy any portion of the source code for use in any other program.
</p>
<P>
    Hercules is <EM>not</EM>, repeat, <EM>not</EM> GPL software! The GNU
    General Public License is a Unix/Linux software licensing agreement,
    which we, the authors, will not participate in. We believe that the
    QPL, which has been certified as compliant with the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Definition</a>,
    provides the benefits and protections of open source for both users and
    developers, without the political baggage that has come to be associated
    with the GPL.
</P>
<P>
<HR>
</P>
<H4><A NAME="2.01">2.01</A>
    Can it run z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes. Hercules is a software implementation of z/Architecture, and so
    it is capable of running z/OS, z/VM, and z/VSE.  Hercules also
    implements ESA/390 (including SIE) and so it can run OS/390, VM/ESA,
    and VSE/ESA, as well as older versions of these operating systems
    such as MVS/ESA, MVS/XA, VM/SP, VSE/SP, etc.
    <p>
    <b>But</b> (and this is a big but), these operating systems are all
    IBM Licensed Program Products, whose conditions of use generally
    restrict their usage to specific IBM machine serial numbers. So you
    cannot just copy these systems from work and run them on your PC.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="2.02">2.02</A>
    What operating systems can I run legally?
</H4>
<P>
    Most 3rd party operating systems like Linux/390, z/Linux and TELPAR
    are covered under their own <em>free</em> license and can therefore
    run under Hercules without any legal problems.
</P>
<P>
    <em>OS/360</em> (PCP, MFT and MVT) is in the public domain, as far
    as we know. The status of OSes for which IBM did not charge a license
    fee is somewhat murky; these include <em>MVS</em> 3.8, <em>VM/370</em>
    release 6, and <em>DOS/VS</em> release 34.
</P>
<P>
    The legal status outside the USA, where something like public domain or
    software without copyright doesn't exist, is "copyrighted software
    provided at no charge". It is a known fact that vendors like
    <em>Amdahl</em>, <em>Hitachi</em>, <em>Nixdorf</em> and others
    modified those operating systems, and distributed them as their own
    OS for their own hardware, without asking IBM for permission. But
    law had been changed over that time, so its not clear if the same
    legal status applies in <b>your</b> country right now.
</P>
<P>
    Rick Fochtman managed to obtain a letter from IBM that he is allowed
    to distribute OS/360. Try to ask your salesdroid for a similar letter
    for VM/370, MVS 3.8j or DOS/VS next time they want to sell you a major
    upgrade.
</P>
<P>
    OS/390, z/OS, and other ESA or z/Architecture operating systems are
    definitely licensed to a
    particular machine. Therefore, in practice you cannot run any classic
    ESA or z/Architecture operating system
    on your PC unless you can obtain a license from
    IBM allowing you to do so. It is believed that there are, however,
    four ways you could run z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE,
    OS/390, VM/ESA, or VSE/ESA under
    Hercules using currently available licenses:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
    Running under Linux on the Pentium processor of a P/390 which is
    licensed to run the OS.
</LI>
<LI>
    Running under Linux/390 on a mainframe which is licensed to run the OS.
</LI>
<LI>
    Running under the terms of a disaster recovery provision of the OS
    license (but I really don't recommend depending on Hercules to be your
    disaster recovery solution!).
</LI>
<LI>
    Using the IBM OS/390 or z/OS DemoPkg, which is available only to
    IBM employees and IBM Business Partners.
</LI>
</OL>
<H4><A NAME="2.03">2.03</A>
    What other programs will run under Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Any program which uses the S/370, ESA/390, or z/Architecture instruction
    set, as implemented in Hercules. Some special utilities in the form of
    standalone programs are known to run well. I can particularly recommend
    Jan Jaeger's excellent standalone editor (ZZSA) which is included in the
    Hercules distribution, or it can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.cbttape.org/~jjaeger">http://www.cbttape.org/~jjaeger</A>;
    I use it regularly to look at DASD while debugging an OS installation,
    which is just what it's designed to do. Note: ZZSA runs in ESA/390 mode.
    See Jan Jaeger's website for more information and special logon procedures.

    What PC hardware do I need to run Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Classic IBM operating systems (OS/360, MVS 3.8, VM/370) are very light by
    today's standards and will run satisfactorily on a 300Mhz Pentium with as
    little as 32MB RAM.
</P>
<P>
    Anything more up-to-date, such as Linux/390 or OS/390, requires much more
    processing power. Hercules is CPU intensive, so you will want to use the
    fastest processor you can get. A 2GHz Pentium, preferably with hyperthreading,
    will probably provide acceptable performance for a light workload.
    If you can afford a multiprocessor system, so much the better. Hercules
    makes extensive use of multi-threading to overlap I/O with CPU activity,
    and to dispatch multiple emulated CPU's in parallel.
</P>
<P>
    For the latest 64-bit operating systems such as zLinux and z/OS, be aware
    that there is a performance penalty when Hercules emulates z/Architecture
    on a 32-bit processor such as the Pentium. If you are serious about running
    64-bit then you will probably want to build Hercules for a 64-bit processor
    such as Alpha (DEC/Compaq/HP), or AMD64 (AMD Opteron, Athlon-64, Turion 64)
    together with a 64-bit version of Linux or PPC (Power Mac G5) with OS X.
</P>
<P>
    Hercules does not depend on the Pentium architecture. I've built and run
    it successfully on a 500 MHz Alpha 21164, and others have run it on SPARC
    and S/390 (!) Linux systems. One guy has even run OS/360 under Hercules
    under Linux/390 under Hercules under Linux/390 under VM/ESA!
    The prize for the world's smallest mainframe probably goes to Ivan Warren,
    who claims to have run VM/370 under Hercules on an iPAQ 5450 handheld PDA.
</P>
<P>
    You should provide enough RAM to accommodate your S/390 real storage
    (main storage plus expanded storage) in addition to the normal
    requirements of your PC's operating system.  For maximum throughput, you
    should set your main and expanded storage sizes high enough to eliminate
    S/390 paging. S/390 storage is allocated out of your PC's virtual storage.
</P>
<P>
    You also need enough hard disk space to accommodate the emulated DASD. A
    virtual "3330 model 1" disk drive will need about 100 megabytes of space
    for emulation (a 3330-11 will need about 200 megabytes). A 3380 "single
    density" model will need about 650MB, a 3390 model 2 needs about 2GB, and
    a 3390 model 3 needs about 3GB.
    If you use the
<a href="cckddasd.html">compressed CKD DASD feature</a>,
    these sizes will shrink dramatically, usually to about 20 to 30 percent
    of the original size.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="3.02">3.02</A>
    What sort of MIPS rate can I expect?
</H4>
<P>
    Thanks to the cumulative work of many individuals, including
    Valery Pogonchenko, Juergen Dobrinski, Albert Louw,
    Gabor Hoffer, Jan Jaeger, Paul Leisy, Clem Clarke,
    and Greg Smith,
    the performance of Hercules today is vastly better than it was
    5 years ago.
</P>
<P>
    Even on a Celeron 300 you should see an execution speed of 1 to 2 MIPS,
    which is enough to run OS/360 (MFT or MVT) or MVS 3.8 with a response
    time better than that of a 3033 from the 1970's. It's also fast enough to
    run VSE/ESA with an acceptable response time. On a more recent system with
    a 2GHz Pentium processor, you may see the system peak at around 30 MIPS
    which is enough to run Linux/390 or z/OS with a light workload.
</P>
<P>
    Performance on server class machines is now fairly respectable.  For
    example, on a dual-core Intel Xeon with hyperthreading (4 CPUs) running
    at 3.46GHz, you might expect to see a sustained MIPS rate of 40 to 60
    MIPS. A dual-processor quad-core Mac Pro (8 cores, 3 GHz) will sustain
    over 150 MIPS.  For anyone who is prepared to spend a considerable
    amount of money on their Hercules system, there are reports that a
    sustained 300+ MIPS has been achieved on an Intel Core i7 processor
    running at 3.75GHz using all four cores plus hyperthreading (8 CPUs).
</P>
<P>
    Typical I/O rates of around 50 EXCP/second are reported on average
    hardware, with rates over 500/second achievable with hardware RAID.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="3.03">3.03</A>
    What PC software do I need to run Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    The following software platforms are supported:
    <li>Linux (kernel 2.4 or later)
    <li>Windows Vista or greater (Windows 7 preferred)
    <li>Mac OS X 10.3 or later
    <li>Solaris 2.9 or later (Sparc or Intel)
    <li>FreeBSD
</P>
<P>
    You will also need tn3270 client software for the virtual 3270
    console.  The tn3270 client can run on the same machine as Hercules, or
    on any Unix or Windows box with a TCP/IP connection to the Hercules
    machine.
</P>
<P>
    The supported and recommended tn3270 clients for Hercules are:
<dl>
<dt>
<B>
    x3270 for Unix
</B>
<dd>
    x3270 is included with most Linux distributions, or you can
    download it from
<a HREF="http://x3270.bgp.nu/">http://x3270.bgp.nu/</A>
<dt>
<B>
    Vista tn3270 for Windows
</B>
<dd>
    Vista tn3270 can be obtained from
<a HREF="http://www.tombrennansoftware.com">www.tombrennansoftware.com</a>.
    The very modest license fee charged for this excellent 3270 emulator
    helps to support an independent software developer.
<dt>
<B>
    Brown University tn3270 for Macintosh
</B>
<dd>
    Brown University tn3270 is freely available. You can download it from <a
    href="http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/CIS/tn3270/">http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/CIS/tn3270/</a>.
    There is one setting that must be changed to use this program with some
    operating systems, especially MVS 3.8: Open a connection to Hercules,
    but before IPLing the system, go to the Session->Features menu and set
    "Change embedded nulls to blanks" to "No". Click on "OK". Now, click on
    File->Save default settings... to make the setting permanent.
</dl>
<P>
    Other tn3270 clients, such as QWS3270, IBM Personal Communications,
    Attachmate Extra, or Dynacomm Elite should also work in most cases, but
    be aware that some tn3270 clients have bugs which make them unusable
    as OS/360 or MVS consoles.

    What software do I need to build Hercules on Linux and Unix?
</H4>
<P>
    To build Hercules for Linux
    and other Unix-like environments (including Cygwin under Windows),
    you need to use the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">gcc</a> compiler,
    version 3.x or above.
    You will also need a full set of GNU development tools,
    including recent versions of
    autoconf, automake, flex, gawk, gcc, grep, m4, make, perl, and sed.
    Refer to the util/bldlvlck file in the Hercules distribution for details.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="3.05">3.05</A>
    What software do I need to build Hercules on Windows?
</H4>
<P>

    To build Hercules for the Windows native environment (without
    Cygwin), you need to use the Microsoft C/C++ compiler (MSVC)
    version 15.x or later (i.e. Visual Studio 2008 or greater).

    The 32-bit compiler and SDK were packaged as Microsoft Visual
    C++ 2008 Express Edition at one point in the past, but unfortunately
    Microsoft no longer offers it for download from their web site.

<p>

    Fish's <a href="http://www.softdevlabs.com">"Software Development
    Laboratories"</a> web site however, has a
    <a href="http://www.softdevlabs.com/hercules-msvc-build.html">
    "Hercules Windows Build Instructions"</a> web page that contains
    download links that are still working should you wish to use Visual
    Studio 2008 Express Edition.

<p>

    The good news is Microsoft's latest offering of their
    <b><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a></b>
    product comes with a free "<b>Community Edition</b>" which <i>should</i>
    be able to successfully build Hercules.

<p>

    Which version of Visual Studio (Microsoft Visual C++) you use to build
    Hercules with is largely unimportant as long as it works. More recent
    versions may or may not provide better performance and may or may not
    successfully build Hercules. The only way to know is to try.

</P>
<H4><A NAME="3.06">3.06</A>
    Can Hercules be ported to run on other platforms?
</H4>
<P>
    With the introduction of autotools, we do make efforts to ensure Hercules
    builds and run on several different operating system platforms (mostly
    Linux, Windows, MAC, Solaris, and FreeBSD right now),
    but we of course simply cannot
    guarantee that it will run on every operating system platform out there.
</P>
<P>
    If you want to make Hercules run on AS/400, OS/2, or
    whatever, then by all means go ahead. I welcome reports of any bugs or
    problems you find, but I probably won't fix problems if it means introducing
    platform-specific code, and I will not be able to test new releases against
    other platforms. Folks who have gotten it compiled on the BSDs report that
    the hardest part is removing the Linux-specific tape support.
</P>
<P>
    The Hercules code is not intended to be specific to Intel hardware, so if
    you find any issues or faults related to running on other hardware (SPARC,
    Alpha, PPC, ...) under Linux, then I'm likely to be receptive to fixing
    that sort of problem. Issues related to Unix variants are less likely
    to be fixed however.

    How can I create a virtual DASD volume?
</H4>
<P>
    The
<A HREF="hercload.html">
    Creating Hercules DASD
</A>
    document describes
    various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD volumes.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="4.02">4.02</A>
    Can I read a tape which was created on a mainframe?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes, indirectly. The mainframe tape must be converted to AWSTAPE format
    and then downloaded to your PC. The
<B><I>tapeconv.jcl</I></B>
    file in the
    Hercules directory contains a sample program which you can run under OS/390
    on your mainframe system. It reads a file from tape and converts it to
    AWSTAPE format. Download the AWSTAPE file to your PC (making sure to choose
<EM>binary</EM>
    format for the download), and then add the downloaded
    filename to the Hercules configuration file as a virtual tape device. You
    will then be able to read the tape file from the virtual tape drive located
    on your PC.
</P>
<P>
<EM>
    Note: the "tapeconv" program will not correctly process input tapes
    whose block size exceeds 32760!
</EM>
    One symptom of this may be the message "
<CODE>ADRY011E I/O ERROR - DEVICE NOT ATTACHED.0000,NA,00...00,0000"</CODE>
    when attempting to restore from tape originally created using the default
    DF/DSS block size. The solution is to recreate the dump tape with
    DCB=BLKSIZE=32760.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="4.03">4.03</A>
    Can I attach a PC tape drive to Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes. Hercules can read and write tapes on SCSI drives. I have tested this
    with 4mm DAT, QIC-1000, and 9-track drives.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="4.04">4.04</A>
    Can I process mainframe tapes with Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes.  It is possible to obtain 9-track open reel drives and 3480-type
    cartridge drives which attach to the SCSI bus.  Hercules makes these
    appear to the operating system as channel-attached 3420 or 3480 devices,
    making it possible to read and write real mainframe tapes.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="4.05">4.05</A>
    Can I create Assembler programs without a mainframe?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes. If you want to write Assembler (BAL) programs to run on Hercules,
    but you don't have access to a mainframe, then there are two interesting
    products which you can run on your PC to assemble programs:
</P>
<DL>
<DT>
    The "Tachyon 390 Cross Assembler" (
<A HREF="http://www.tachyonsoft.com/tachyon">http://www.tachyonsoft.com/tachyon</A>
    )
</DT>
<DD>
    With this assembler you can produce S/390-compatible object decks using
    your Linux or Windows PC. A high degree of HLASM compatibility, coupled with
    the ability to perform complex assemblies at lightning speed, make this a
    product which is well worth looking at. I have tried this assembler and it
    is truly amazing.
</DD>
<DT>
    The "Dignus Systems/C Compiler" (
<A HREF="http://www.dignus.com/">http://www.dignus.com</A>
    )
</DT>
<DD>
    This is a C compiler which runs under Windows or Linux and generates
    mainframe assembler code which you can then assemble using the Tachyon
    assembler.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
    Sam Golob wrote a fascinating review of these two products in the
    September 1999 issue of <A HREF="http://www.naspa.com">NaSPA</a>
