<h2><a NAME="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Using compressed DASD files you can significantly reduce the file space
required for emulated DASD files and possibly gain a performance boost
because less physical I/O occurs.

Both <b>CKD</b> (Count-Key-Data) and <b>FBA</b> (Fixed-Block-Architecture)
emulation files can be compressed.
<p>
In regular (or uncompressed) files, each CKD track or FBA block occupies
a specific spot in the emulation file.  The offset of the track or block
in the file can be directly calculated knowing the track or block number
and the maximum size of the track or block.  In compressed files, each
track image or group of blocks may be compressed by
<a href="http://www.zlib.net/"><b>zlib</b></a> or
<a href="http://www.bzip.org/"><b>bzip2</b></a>, and only
occupies the space neccessary for the compressed image.  The offset of a compressed
track or block is obtained by performing a two-table lookup.  The lookup
tables themselves reside in the emulation file.
<p>
Because FBA blocks are 512 bytes in length, and that being a rather small
number, FBA blocks are grouped into <b>block groups</b>.  Each block group
contains 120 FBA blocks (60K).
<p>
Whenever a track or block group is written to a compressed file,
it is written either to an existing free space within the file, or at
the end of the file, then the lookup tables are updated, and then the space the
track or block group previously occupied is freed.  The location of a
track or block group in the file can change many times.
<p>
In the event of a failure (for example, Hercules crash,
operating system crash or power failure), the compressed emulation file
on the host's physical disk may be out of sync if the host operating
system defers physical writes to the file system containing the emulation
file.  Several methods have evolved to reduce the amount of data lost in
these kind of events.
<p>
A compressed file may occupy only 20% of the disk space required by an
uncompressed file.  In other words, you may be able to have 5 times more
emulated volumes using compressed DASD files.  However, compressed files
are more sensitive to failures and corruption may occur.

<p>
<hr noshade>

<p><h2><a NAME="shadowfiles">Shadow Files</a></h2>

<p>

A compressed CKD or FBA dasd can have more than one physical file.
The additional files are called <em>shadow files</em>.
The function is implemented as a kind of <i>snapshot</i>, where
a new shadow file can be created on demand.
An emulated dasd is represented by a <em>base</em> file and 0 or more
shadow files.  All files are opened <em>read-only</em>
except for the <em>current</em> file, which is opened <em>read-write</em>.

<p>

Shadow files are specified by the <b>sf=</b><i>shadow-file-name</i> parameter
on the device statement for the compressed DASD device.

<p class="note">

    Please note that the specified shadow filename does <u>not</u> have to
    actually exist. The <i>shadow-file-name</i> operand of the <i>sf=</i>
    parameter is simply a filename <i><u>template</u></i> that will be used
    to name the shadow file whenever a shadow file is to be created, but
    shadow files do not actually get created until you specifically create
    them via the <code>sf+xxxx</code> (or <code>sf+*</code>) command. Please
    refer to the discussion of the <b>sf</b> command several paragraphs
    below for more information.

<p>

The <b>shadow file name</b> should have spot where the shadow file number will be set.
This is either the character immediately preceding the filename extension
or the last character of the file name itself if there is no extension.
<p>
For example, the following device statement:<br>
<pre>
    0001  2311  VOL111.model-x.ext   sf=VOL111_Shadow_0.model-x.ext
</pre>
will cause a shadow file named:
<pre>
                                        VOL111_Shadow_0.model-1.ext
</pre>
to be created, whereas the following slightly different device statement:
<pre>
    0002  2311  VOL222.model-x.ext   sf=VOL222.model-x_Shadow_0.ext
</pre>
will cause a shadow file with the following name to be created:
<pre>
                                        VOL222.model-x_Shadow_1.ext
</pre>

<p>

Please notice the placement of the shadow file number in the two examples:
it is always immediately before the <i>last</i> period of the filename.
In earlier versions of Hercules the shadow file number was
erroneously placed immediately before the <i>first</i> period of the
filename instead of the last period. In newer versions of Hyperion
this has been corrected to place the number immediately before the
<i>last</i> period, as it was originally intended.

<p>
There can be up to 8 shadow files in use at any time for an
emulated dasd device.  The base file is designated file<b>[0]</b> and
the shadow files are file<b>[1]</b> to file<b>[8]</b>.
The <em>highest</em> numbered file in use at a given time is the <em>current</em>
file, where all writes will occur.  Track reads start with the <em>current</em>
file and proceed down until a file is found that actually contains the track
image.
<p>
A shadow file contains all the changes made to the emulated dasd
since it was created, until the next shadow file is created.  The moment
of the shadow file's creation can be thought of as a <em>snapshot</em>
of the current emulated dasd as it existed at that point in time, because
if the shadow file is later removed, then the emulated dasd reverts back
to the state it was in at the moment the snapshot was taken.
<p>
Using shadow files, you can keep the base file on a read-only device
such as cdrom, or change the base file attributes to read-only,
ensuring that this file can never be corrupted.
<p>
Hercules console commands are provided to add a new shadow file, remove
the current shadow file (with or without backward merge), compress the
curent shadow file, and display the shadow file status and statistics:<br><br>

<p><h2><a NAME="filestructure">Compressed DASD File Structure</a></h2>

<p>
A compressed DASD file has 6 types of spaces, a <em><u>device header</u></em>,
a <em><u>compressed device header</u></em>, a <em><u>primary lookup table</u></em>,
<em>secondary lookup tables</em>, track or block group <em>images</em>,
and <em>free spaces</em>.  The first 3 types only occur once, at the
beginning of the file in order.  The rest of the file is occupied by
the other 3 space types.
<p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<br>

The very first 512 bytes of a compressed DASD file is the <b>device header</b>.
The device header contains an "eye-catcher" that identifies the file type
(CKD or FBA and base or shadow):

<p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<table>
<tr><th> Device-id <th> Dasd image type </tr>
<tr><td> CKD_P370 <td> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normal (plain) CKD dasd image </tr>
<tr><td> CKD_C370 <td> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed CKD dasd image </tr>
<tr><td> CKD_S370 <td> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed CKD dasd Shadow file </tr>
<tr><td> FBA_P370 <td> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normal (plain) FBA dasd image </tr>
<tr><td> FBA_C370 <td> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed FBA dasd image </tr>
<tr><td> FBA_S370 <td> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed FBA dasd Shadow file </tr>
</table>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p><br>

The device type and file size information
is also specified in this header.  The header is identical to the header used
for uncompressed CKD files except for the eye-catcher:

<br><br>

After the compressed device header is the <b>primary lookup table</b>
(also called the Level 1 table or <em>L1tab</em>.)

Each 4 byte unsigned entry in the <i>L1tab</i> contains the file offset
of a <em><u>secondary lookup table</u></em> (or <em>level 2 table</em> or <em>L2tab</em>).

<p>

The track or block group number being accessed divided by 256 gives the index
into the <i>L1tab</i>.  That is, each L1tab entry (<i>CCKD_L1ENT</i>) represents
256 tracks or block groups. The number of entries in the <i>L1tab</i> is dependent
on the size of the emulated device:

Following the primary lookup table (<em>L1tab</em>),
in no particular order, are:
<b>secondary lookup tables</b> (<em>L2tabs</em>),
<em>track or block group images</em>, and
<em>free spaces</em>.

<p>

Each <b>secondary lookup table</b> (or <em>L2tab</em>),
contains 256 eight byte entries.

The entry is indexed by the remainder of the track or block group number divided by 256.

<p>

Each L2 entry contains an unsigned 4 byte <i>offset</i> to the track or block group image
(file offset to where the image begins),

an unsigned 2 byte track or block group <i>length</i> (the actual amount of data
contained on the track or block group)

and an unsigned 2 byte <i>size</i> of the track or block group image (i.e. how much
space is actually available for use at that particular file offset).

<p>

The length is the amount of available space currently being consumed by the
track or block group image, and the size is the amount of space actually available.

The size of course may be greater than the length to prevent short free spaces
from accumulating in the file.

A <b>track image</b> or <b>block group image</b> contains two fields:

a 5-byte <em><u>header</u></em>
and a variable amount of data that may or may not be compressed.

The length field (<i>L2_len</i>) in the secondary lookup table entry (<i>CCKD_L2ENT</i>)
show just above, includes the length of both the 5-byte header
as well as the track or block group data.

<p>

The 5-byte <i>track or block group <u>header</u></i> contains a 1 byte compression indicator
and 4 bytes that identify the track or block group. The format of the identifier
depends on whether the emulated device is CKD or FBA:

<p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<table border=1 width="21.875%">

<tr><th width="100%" colspan="5">CKD Track Header</th></tr>
<tr>
    <th width="6.25%">0</th>

    <td align="center" colspan="2"><font size=-1>HH</font></td>
</tr>

<p>

</table>

<p>

For <b>CKD</b>, the 2 byte CC is the cylinder number of the track image
and the HH is the head number.  These numbers are stored in <em>big-endian</em>
byte order.  When the compression indicator byte is zero the 5 byte header
is identical to the <em>Home Address</em> (or <em>HA</em>) for the track image.
<p>
The data, which may or may not be compressed, begins with the <em>R0</em>
count and ends with the <em>end-of-track</em> marker,
which is a count field containing <code>FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</code> (eight hex x'FF's).

The Home Address plus the uncompressed track data comprise the track image.

<p>

    <td align="center" colspan="4"><font size=-1>nnnnnnnn</font></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>

For <b>FBA</b>, the 4 byte nnnnnnnn is the <em>big-endian</em> sector number
of the block group (i.e. the sector or block number of the first block in the group).

The block group data (the individual sectors in the block group), which may or
may not be compressed (depending on the <i>cmp</i> flag), follows immediately
after the block group header.

There is of course no end-of-track marker at the end of an FBA block group.
(FBA devices do not have tracks.)

<p>

Please note that while the <i>FBA Block Group Header</i> is the first part
of the block group, it is <i><u>not</u></i> part of the compressed image.
Only the sectors themselves (which immediately follow the <i>Block Group Header</i>)
are actually compressed. FBA devices do not have Track Headers (Home Addresses).
The <i>FBA Block Group Header</i> should be considered an internal structure
and is never exposed to the guest.

The minimum length of a free space is 8 bytes.

The free space chain is ordered by file offset
and no two free spaces are adjacent.

The chain is terminated when a free space has zero offset to the next free space.

The <b>compressed device header</b> contains the offset
to the first free space (<i>free_off</i>).


<p>

The free space chain is read when the file is opened
for read-write and written when the file is closed.
The free space chain is maintained in storage while the file is opened.

<p><h2><a NAME="howitworks">How It Works</a></h2>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>
A track or block group image is read while executing a channel
program or by the <em>readahead</em> thread.  An image has to
be read before it is updated or written to.  An image may be <em>cached</em>.
If an image is cached, then the channel program may complete
<em>synchronously</em>.  This means that if all the data a channel program
accesses is cached and Hercules does not have to perform physical I/O,
then the channel program runs synchronously within the SSCH or SIO
instruction in the <em>CPU</em> thread.  All DASD channel programs are started
synchronously.  If a CCW in the channel program requires physical I/O
then the channel program is interrupted and restarted at that CCW
<em>asynchronously</em> in a <em>device I/O</em> thread.
<p>
All compressed devices share a common cache; the devices can be a mixture
of FBA and/or CKD device types.  Each cache entry contains a pointer to
a 64K buffer containing an uncompressed track or block group image.
If the track or block group image being read is not found in the cache,
then the oldest (or <em>least recently used</em> or <em>LRU</em>) entry that
is not <em>busy</em> is <em>stolen</em>.  A cache entry is busy if it is
being read, or last accessed by an <em>active</em> channel program, or updated
but not yet written, or being written.  If no cache entries are available then
the read must enter a <em>cache wait</em>.  When images are detected to be
accessed sequentially then the readahead thread(s) may be signalled to read
following sequential images.
<p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>
When a cache entry is updated or written to, a bit is turned on indicating
the cache entry has been updated.  When a <em>cache wait</em> occurs, or
(more likely) during space recovery, a cache <em>flush</em> is performed.
When the cache is flushed, if any entries have the updated bit on, then
the writer thread(s) are signalled.  The writer thread selects the oldest
cache entry with the updated bit on, compresses the image, and writes it
to the file.  The new image is written to a new space in the file and then
the space previously occupied by the image is freed.  In certain circumstances,
the image may be written under <em>stress</em>.  A stress write occurs when
a reading thread is in a <em>cache wait</em> or when a high percentage of
cache entries are pending write.  In this circumstance, the compression
parameters are relaxed to reduce the CPU requirements.  An image written
under stress is likely to take up more space than the same image written
not under stress.  The writer thread(s) run 1 nicer than the CPU thread(s);
compression is a CPU intensive activity.
<p>
<h3>Space Recovery</h3>
<p>
Space recovery is also called, somewhat inaccurately, garbage collection.
The primary function of the space recovery thread, or garbage collector,
is to keep the emulated compressed DASD files as small as possible.
After all, that is the reason for using compressed DASD files in the first
place.
<p>
When a track or block group image is written, it is written to a new
location in the file.  It is either written to an existing free space
within the file or to the end of the file, increasing the size of the
file.  The space previously occupied by the image is freed, but it is
not immediately available for space allocation requests.  Instead, it
is <i>pending</i> free space.  It is assigned a <i>pending value</i>
(typically 2) that is decremented each space recovery cycle (typically
every 10 seconds).  When the pending value reaches 0 then the space is
available for allocation.  This increases the chance that a track or
block group image can be recovered in the event of a failure.
<p>
The space recovery routine relocates track or block group
images towards the beginning of the file, causing free space to move
towards the end of the file.  When a free space reaches the end of the
file, it `falls off', that is, the file size is reduced.
<p>
Simply, the space recovery routine selects a space after a sufficiently
large <i>non-pending</i> free space.  It then reads and writes consecutive
spaces using the normal cckd read and write routines.  The space read will
become <i>pending</i> free space and will hopefully be written to a
<i>non-pending</i> free space occurring earlier in the file.  Sometimes it
is necessary to write the space later in the file to increase free space
size earlier in the file.  Left to itself, the space recovery routine will
eventually remove all free space from the file.  However, it is not
intended to be a replacement for the cckdcomp utility; rather, the intent
is to provide sufficient free space to prevent excessive file growth.
<p>
Another function performed by space recovery is to relocate <em>L2</em> (secondary
lookup) tables towards the beginning of the file.  This enables the
<i>chkdsk</i> function to complete more quickly during initialization and
simplifies chkdsk recovery.

        In the event of a catastrophic failure, previously written track or
        block group images should be recoverable if the current image has

        garbage collector wants to reduce the free space to used space ratio
        and the number of free spaces).  The value is logarithmic; a value
        of 8 means moving 2<sup>8</sup> the selected value while a negative
        value similarly decreases the amount to be moved.  Normally, 256K
        will be moved for a file in an interval.  Specifying a value of 8 can
        increase the amount to 64M.  At least 64K will be moved.  Interestingly,
