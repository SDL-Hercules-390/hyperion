<h1>The Hercules System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture Emulator</h1>

<hr noshade>
<center><h2>SDL Hercules 4.x Hyperion</h2></center>
<hr noshade>

<p>

This is the official web page for the SDL 4.x version
of the hercules-390 mainframe emulator, code named <b>"Hyperion"</b>.

<br /><br />

<b>Hercules</b> is an open source software implementation of the mainframe
System/370 and ESA/390 architectures, in addition to the latest 64-bit
z/Architecture. Hercules runs under Linux, Windows,
Solaris, FreeBSD,
and Mac OS X.

<br /><br />

This version of Hercules is the <b>SDL</b> version of the Hercules emulator
containing fixes to address bugs that may or may not still exist in the
original 3.x and/or 4.0 versions of Hercules, or to add new features and
functionality above and beyond what exists in the original versions.
SDL Hercules 4.x Hyperion is consider to be the most current up to date
version of the Hercules emulator in existence at the time this writing.

<p>

<b>Hercules was created by</b> Roger Bowler.
Jay Maynard (&#8220;the Tron Guy&#8221;) was the maintainer from 2000 to 2012.
Jan Jaeger designed and implemented many of the advanced features of
Hercules, including dynamic reconfiguration, integrated console,
interpretive execution and z/Architecture support. A dedicated crew of
programmers is constantly at work implementing new features and fixing bugs.

<p>

<b>Please Note</b> that this version of Hercules is only called the "SDL" version
in order to distinguish it from any other versions of Hercules that may be out
there, and not for any other reason.

This version of Hercules was neither created by, nor is owned by, nor maintained
or supported by
<a href="http://www.softdevlabs.com">Software Development Laboratories</a>.

Hercules it not the work of any one person. It was created by <i><u>many</u></i>
very smart and talented individuals over the course of many years. For a list
of just <i>some</i> of these many very talented people, please refer to question
<a href="https://sdl-hercules-390.github.io/html/hercfaq.html#6.01">6.01 of our FAQ</a>.

<h3>What people are saying about Hercules</h3>

<p>

<em>&#147;
Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to see MVS
running on a machine that I personally own.
Hercules is a marvelous tool.  My thanks to you all for a job
very well done.
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Reed H. Petty
<p>
<em>&#147;
I do miss my mainframe a lot, and playing with Herc sure brings back
memories.  Just seeing the IBM message prefixes, and responding to
console messages again was a wonderful bit of nostalgia!
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Bob Brown
<p>
<em>&#147;
I have installed your absolutely fantastic /390 emulator.
You won't believe what I felt when I saw the prompt.
Congratulations, this is a terrific software.
I really have not had such a fascinating and interesting
time on my PC lately.
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
IBM Large Systems Specialist
<p>
<em>&#147;
Such simulators have been available for a long time.  One of the most
complete (up to modern 64-bit z/Architecture) is hercules.
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Michel Hack, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center
<p>
<em>&#147;
An apparently excellent emulator that allows those open source
developers with an "itch to scratch", to come to the S/390 table
and contribute.
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Mike MacIsaac, IBM
<p>
<em>&#147;
BTW grab a copy of Hercules and you can test it at home.
It's a very good S/390 and zSeries (S/390 64bit) emulator..
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Alan Cox
<p>
<em>&#147;
It works even better than I imagined.
Hercules is a fine piece of software!
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Dave Sienkiewicz
<p>
<em>&#147;
Hercules is a systems programmer's dream come true.
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Ren&eacute; Vincent Jansen
<p>
<em>&#147;
Aside from the electric trains my parents got
me in 1953, this is the best toy I've ever been given,
bar none.&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Jeffrey Broido
<p>
<em>&#147;
Congratulations to you and your team on a fine piece of work!
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Rich Smrcina
<p>
<em>&#147;
Congratulations on a magnificent achievement!
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Mike Ross
<p>
<em>&#147;
For anyone thinking running Hercules is too much trouble or too hard
or whatever, I came home from work one day and my 13 year old 8th
grade son had MVS running under VM under Hercules on Linux. He had
gotten all the information about how to do this from the Internet.
When he complained about MVS console configuration and figuring out
how to get it to work with VM, I knew he had felt all the pain he
ever needed to feel about mainframes.
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Scott Ledbetter, StorageTek
<p>
<em>&#147;
I am running a fully graphical Centos z/Linux environment on my desktop.
The Hercules emulator is an amazing feat of engineering.
I just wanted to send my compliments to the team for an excellent job!
Thanks much for making this product part of the open-source community!
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Roby Gamboa
<p>
<em>&#147;
I have DOS and DOS/VS running on Hercules with
some demo applications, both batch and on-line.  It does bring back
some good memories. My compliments go to the Hercules team.  Thank you.
&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
Bill Carlborg
<p>
<em>&#147;
This is stunning piece of work. To say that I am blown away is an
understatement. I have a mainframe on my notebook!!!!!!
P.S. Now if I can just remember my JCL&#148;</em>
<br>&#151;
