BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

SoftFloat 3a For Hercules (S3FH) is built from source using the
following process:

- Install the prerequisite software for your host system, including
  the correct version of CMake.
- Clone SoftFloat 3a For Hercules into a directory tree.
- Position yourself in the top source directory, SoftFloat-3a.
- Issue "1Stop".  This script performs the following tasks using the defaults.
        . Create required directory structure.
        . Configure the build using CMake.
        . Compile sources into a build directory.
        . Install the build library, public headers, and license files  into
          an installation directory.
- Configure the Hercules Hyperion build to find s3fh in the installation
  directory, as documented in the Hercules v4 build instructions.
  (Note: 1Stop places SoftFloat 3a For Hercules in the directory structure
  expected by the Hercules V4 build process; no configuration is needed.)

1Stop is available for open source and Windows hosts and will build
SoftFloat 3a For Hercules with the same bit-ness as your host system.
For Windows users, 1Stop will use the most modern version of Visual Studio
available on your system with the default c compiler.

If you use the recommended directory structure described below,
there is no need to configure the Hyperion build.


PREREQUISITE SOFTWARE - UNIX

- CMake version 3.2 or better
- A git command-line tool or better.
- A c compiler at a level sufficient to build Hyperion.

Note 1.  Git is not required if, instead of cloning SoftFloat 3a For
         Hercules, you download the .zip file offered by github.com.
         If you plan to develop, use Git.
Note 2.  Github.com offers a zip file, not a tar.gz, even when you
         access the site from a browser on a UNIX graphical desktop.
         So, although UNIX trades in tar.gz, github.com has not
         received the memo.  If the ark command on your UNIX does
         not handle .zip files, 7zip can be used.


PREREQUISITE SOFTWARE - Windows

- CMake version 3.2 or better
- Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
- A Windows SDK compatible with the target Windows version.
- Posh-git command line github client.

Note 1.  Earlier versions of Visual Studio may be used and should
         work, but they have not been tested by this author.
Note 2.  Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition has no license fee when
         used by individual developers or for qualifying open-source
         licensed software (OSI-verified).
Note 3.  Posh-git is installed as part of the Github for Windows
         GUI client, available at https://desktop.github.com/.  It
         can also be installed stand-alone from its own git repository,
         at https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git.
Note 4.  A command-line git client is not required if you are only
         building; you can download the zip file from github.com.
         If you are developing, you will need a git client.

(I believe Posh-git is so named because it uses Windows Power Shell,
not because it is particularly rich or luxurious.)


INSTALLING CMAKE

SoftFloat 3a For Hercules requires CMake 3.2 or better.  Pre-built
binaries are available for Windows, and sources for building on
open source host systems are available at:

    https://cmake.org/download/

Some open source systems have 3.2 or better in their repositories.
If your open source host system does not have 3.2 or better available,
you will have to build CMake from using its bootstrap process.

Instructions for building CMake from scratch can be found in the
README.rst contained in the source download file.  These instructions
for CMake 3.7.1 are reproduced here for convenience.  Note that the
README.rst is authoritative for the build process.

   Building CMake from Scratch
   ---------------------------

   UNIX/Mac OSX/MinGW/MSYS/Cygwin
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   You need to have a compiler and a make installed.
   Run the ``bootstrap`` script you find in the source directory of CMake.
   You can use the ``--help`` option to see the supported options.
   You may use the ``--prefix=<install_prefix>`` option to specify a custom
   installation directory for CMake. You can run the ``bootstrap`` script from
   within the CMake source directory or any other build directory of your
   choice. Once this has finished successfully, run ``make`` and
   ``make install``.  In summary::

    $ ./bootstrap && make && make install

   Windows
   ^^^^^^^

   You need to download and install a binary release of CMake in order to build
   CMake.  You can get these releases from the `CMake Download Page`_ .  Then
   proceed with the instructions below.

   .. _`CMake Download Page`: https://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

A documentation page is also available on the cmake.org web site, but it
is apparently not linked to by any page a rational user would open
during a search for build instructions.  This author could not find the
link, anyway, without using the site's search function.

   https://cmake.org/install/


RECOMMENDED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

You can skip this step and the "Prepare" and "Perform" steps below if
you did the one stop shopping by "/1Stop".

Or read on if you are curious.

The parent directory of the build and install directories, "x86" in
the example below, enables multiple target systems for builds.

It should be at the same level as the Hyperion source directory, and
while it may be anything you wish, the following defaults are
recommended.

- On Windows, use the value of the %PROCESSOR-ARCHITECTURE% environment
  variable to avoid the need for step 4. above.
- On UNIX, use the value returned by uname -m.

hercules/hyperion/             # Hyperion source (see Note 1.)
        /SoftFloat-3a          # SoftFloat 3a For Hercules source
        /x86/hyperion/         # Hyperion build/install directory
        /x86/s3fh              # S3FH install dir
                               # ..includes copyright notices
        /x86/s3fh/lib          # contains S3FH s3fhFloat.lib
        /x86/s3fh/include      # contains S3FH public headers
        /x86/s3fh.release      # S3FH Release build dir
        /x86/s3fh.debug        # S3FH Debug build dir

Note 1.  The s3fh install, release build, and debug build directories
must be named as shown above.  Changing these names means you will need
to configure the Hyperion build to deal with non-standard directory
names.

Note 2.  When building Hyperion under Windows, the source directory is
also the build directory and may also be the install directory.


PREPARE TO BUILD FROM SOURCE - Windows

1) Open a Visual Studio command prompt from the Windows Start menu.
   VS2015 offers several; choose from the following

      32-bit Windows "VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt"
      64-bit Windows "VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt"

   Use this command prompt for the remaining steps.

2) Determine the processor architecture

    echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%

3) Build the recommended directory tree.  Substitute the value of
   %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% for "x86" in the directory names below.

    mkdir hercules\hyperion
    mkdir hercules\SoftFloat-3a
    mkdir hercules\x86\hyperion
    mkdir hercules\x86\s3fh
    mkdir hercules\x86\s3fh.release
    mkdir hercules\x86\s3fh.debug

The remaining directories are built by CMake.


PREPARE TO BUILD FROM SOURCE - UNIX

1) Open terminal or console prompt.  You can perform this procedure
   an SSH connection to the UNIX system used for the build.  Use this
   command prompt for the remaining steps.

2) Determine the processor architecture

    uname -m

3) Build the recommended directory tree.  Substitute the result
   returned from uname -m for "amd64" in the directory names below.

    mkdir hercules/hyperion
    mkdir hercules/SoftFloat-3a
    mkdir hercules/amd64/hyperion
    mkdir hercules/amd64/s3fh
    mkdir hercules/amd64/s3fh.release
    mkdir hercules/amd64/s3fh.debug

The remaining directories are built by CMake.  You may omit s3fh if you
do not plan a debug build.  For day-to-day use, a release build is fine.


PERFORM THE RELEASE BUILD FROM SOURCE

The same commands are used to perform the build in Windows and in UNIX.
CMake will translate the forward slashes in its command line to the
orientation required by the host operating system.

1) Change to the top level in the directory structure

    cd hercules

2) Clone the SoftFloat 3a For Hercules repository

    git clone https://github.com/hercules-390/SoftFloat-3a.git

3) Run cmake to create build and installation control files

      cd x86                   #or whatever the install TLD is
      cd s3fh.release
      cmake ../../SoftFloat-3a  # Open source systems

    Windows users will need to add a -G option to generate for the
    correct bit-ness and Visual Studio version.  For example, for a
    64-bit build with Visual Studio 2015:

      cmake ../../SoftFloat-3a -G "Visual Studio 14.0 2015 Win64"

    Use cmake --help to match your version of Visual Studio to the
    option.  For Visual Studio 2015, here are your choices:

      32-bit:  -G "Visual Studio 14.0 2015"
      64-bit:  -G "Visual Studio 14.0 2015 Win64"

    Recall that 1Stop does all of this for you.

4) Run cmake  to build SoftFloat 3a For Hercules.  This corresponds to
   a UNIX "make" command, and indeed, if you are building on UNIX, you
   could use make.  On Windows, you could use Visual Studio 2015 for
   this step.

    cmake --build . --clean-first --config Release

   Do not forget the dot in the above command.   "--clean-first" is
   not required on the first build, but will not cause problems.

5) Run cmake to install SoftFloat 3a For Hercules.  This step copies
   the library, public headers, and license documents into the
   install directory tree, x86 in the example above.  This corresponds
   to a UNIX "make install" command, and you can use that command if
   you prefer.  There is no equivalent way to do this in Visual Studio
   2015.

    cmake -P cmake_install.cmake

At this point, SoftFloat 3a For Hercules has been built and you may
continue by building Hercules.


PERFORM A DEBUG BUILD FROM SOURCE

Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5 as for a release build with the following
changes.  A debug build creates the library SoftFloat_D.lib (Windows)
or libSoftFloat_D.a (non-Windows).  A Hyperion debug build will expect
the "_D" library.

3. Use directory s3fh.debug instead of s3fh.release

5. Use the following command to install the debug build.

    cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug -P cmake_install.cmake

   If your host system is UNIX-based, you may omit -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug.
   See the Appendix below on the need for -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug.


APPENDIX: DETAILS ON THE NEED FOR -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug

According to the legacy CMake bug tracker, build trees built for Visual
Studio or OS/X have multiple configurations included in a single tree,
and the install script needs the BUILD_TYPE passed to it from the
command line to install the correct configuration.

See the following post to issue 11950 in that bug tracker.  Note that
the bug under discussion is not related to Windows or OS/X.

  https://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=11950#c25717


APPENDIX: TECHNICAL NOTES ON THE BUILD

The tool chosen to build the package is CMAKE, and the CMakeLists.txt
file uses the name of the build directory to determine:

- the name of the install directory
- whether a release or debug build should be done.

As follows:

To build a release configuration to be installed in the "soft"
directory, the build should take place in a directory named:

      soft.release

The build directory can be located anywhere, in any directory tree,
so long as you have read/write/execute permissions in the parent
directory.

For a different naming convention or layout, use the following CMake
command in the build directory

cmake <path to source> -DINSTALL_PREFIX=<the install prefix>  \
                       -DBUILD_TYPE=<the build type>

<path to source> may be relative or absolute.


APPENDIX: TESTING SOFTFLOAT-3A FOR HERCULES

All testing of SoftFloat-3a is done after Hercules is built; no direct
test driver has been created for SoftFload 3a For Hercules.

Twenty-three Hercules test cases, all starting with "BFP-", exist in the
tests subdirectory of Hercules V4.  Four files exist per case:

 .asm    z/Arch assembly-language source code
 .core   Assembled binary test case code, to be used with the Hercules
         loadcore command.
 .lst    Assembly listing, generated by the assembler included with SATK
 .tst    Test case execution script

The execution script contains statements to run the test case and
compare its results to those created on a z/Architecture mainframe.

The source code can be modified as needed and reassembled using the
assembler included in Harold Grovesteen's excellent Stand-Alone Tool
Kit (SATK).  You can find the complete tool kit, including detailed
documentation, on github at:
