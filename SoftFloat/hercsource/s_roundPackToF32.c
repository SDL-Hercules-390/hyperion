/*============================================================================
Modifications to comply with IBM IEEE Binary Floating Point, as defined
in the z/Architecture Principles of Operation, SA22-7832-10, by
Stephen R. Orso.  Said modifications identified by compilation conditioned
on preprocessor variable IBM_IEEE.
All such modifications placed in the public domain by Stephen R. Orso.
Modifications:
 1) Saved rounded result with unbounded unbiased exponent to enable
    return of a scaled rounded result, required by many instructions.
 2) Added rounding mode softfloat_round_stickybit, which corresponds to 
    IBM Round For Shorter precision (RFS).
 3) Added reporting of softfloat_flag_tiny when the result is tiny, even
    if the result is tiny and exact.
 4) Added reporting of softfloat_flag_incremented when the significand was 
    increased in magnitude by rounding.
